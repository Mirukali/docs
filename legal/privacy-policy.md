**Discord Information**

User IDs are stored as unique identifiers and names are cached for display. For example, we grant experience for completing tasks, store that experience based on User ID, and display current experience with the username. Server IDs are similarly stored so that server participation can be tracked and displayed. For example, with a server leaderboard. Channel IDs are stored for identification of channel-specific configurations of bot features.

User Discord information will be automatically deleted 30 days after Miruka's last use. A user can also request the deletion of their data via our dashboard. Server IDs are similarly stored for the duration of the Server's interaction with Miruka. Channel IDs are stored for the duration of the use of the bot in a channel and deleted automatically once that interaction has ended. Message IDs are stored for the duration of a bot interaction and deleted automatically once that interaction has ended.
