To deposit and/or withdraw Crypto Assets via the Miruka wallet , you agree to pay a transaction fee (a "Network Fee") for every transaction that occurs on the network. The Network Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized network. This means that you will need to pay a Network Fee for each transaction.

We do not provide refunds for any transaction that you might make on or through the Miruka Platform â€“ whether for Miruka or anything else. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes, gas fees, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your use of the Miruka software, except for income taxes levied on us as a result of such using Miruka.

### Reward System and Off-Chain Bank Functionality Policy <a href="#reward-system-and-off-chain-bank-functionality-policy" id="reward-system-and-off-chain-bank-functionality-policy"></a>

1. **Reward Wallet and Off-Chain Bank System**

1.1 Reward Wallet Responsibility: By using the Bank, you agree to maintain a sufficient balance in your designated Reward Wallet to cover any claims made by community members. This custodial wallet, accessible through the Miruka dashboard, must be adequately funded to fulfill reward claims in a timely and accurate manner.

1.2 Bank System Overview: The Bank system offers a flexible off-chain solution to manage community rewards with reduced on-chain gas fees. When enabled, the Bank system allows rewards to be tallied as an off-chain balance for each community member until they claim these rewards. You, as the project administrator, moderator or team member, are responsible for setting the claim availability and frequency in relation to the balance available in your Reward Wallet and are fully responsible for maintaining that balance.

1.3 Claim Process: In order for a claim to be successfully processed, the reward wallet must have an available balance equal to or exceeding the total of the claims. Monitoring and maintaining the Reward Wallet balance is the responsibility of the project, and our service does not guarantee successful claims if sufficient funds are not available.

2. **Prohibited Uses and Violations**

2.1 System Exploitation: Any attempt to exploit the Bank system or other reward mechanisms, including but not limited to, manipulating off-chain balances or falsely rewarding users without a sufficient balance, is strictly prohibited and will result in an account suspension or permanent ban.

2.2 Account Suspension: Violation of any terms, including misuse or exploitation of the Bank system or Reward Wallet, may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account without prior notice, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to take any additional actions as necessary to protect our platform and other users from fraudulent activity.
