# NFT

### **NFT Overview**

#### **What are NFTs in the Game?**

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that players can mint, trade, and use within the game or on external platforms like OpenSea. Each NFT represents a one-of-a-kind item, character skin, or collectible from the game.

#### **Key Features**

* **Unique Ownership**: NFTs are tied to the blockchain, ensuring that no two are alike and each is verifiably owned by a specific wallet.
* **Tradable**: NFTs can be traded or sold in external marketplaces such as OpenSea or within the in-game marketplace.
* **Utility**: Some NFTs provide in-game bonuses, exclusive abilities, or aesthetic customizations.
