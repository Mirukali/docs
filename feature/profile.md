#### <mark style="color:orange;">Overview</mark>

Each user has a unique profile in the system. Upon profile creation, the bot generates a dedicated EVM wallet address on the Polygon network. Rewards are distributed based on multiple criteria, detailed below.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Reward Criteria**</mark>

* **Account Age**: Based on the account creation date. Accounts less than one year old receive a 5% reduction in rewards (only applicable to accounts older than one month).
* **Badges**: Specific rewards for users with particular badges, such as:
  * **Nitro Subscriber**
  * **Server Booster**
  * **Early Supporter** (special badge)
  * **Bug Hunter** (special badge)
  * **Active Developer** (only available for verified public bots; requires submission)
* **Profile Completeness**: Additional rewards for users with an avatar and banner.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Profile Deletion and Wallet Export**</mark>

Users have the option to request profile deletion. If a user does not export their wallet before deletion, the wallet remains associated with the bot. If the wallet is exported prior to deletion, all associated data, including the seed phrase and private key, is permanently removed from the database.
