# Profile

## <mark style="color:orange;">**Overview**</mark>

Each user has a unique profile within the system. Upon creating a profile, the bot automatically generates a dedicated EVM wallet address on the Polygon network.

The profile serves as the player's hub, displaying essential information such as:

* **Level**: Track your progress and unlock new features.
* **Currencies**: View your Gold, Miru Points, and Tokens balance.
* **Equipment**: Manage and monitor your equipped items and inventory.

This is your go-to place to keep track of your journey and achievements in the game.

## <mark style="color:orange;">**Reward Criteria**</mark>

Profiles can earn additional rewards based on the following criteria:

1. **Account Age**
   * Rewards are influenced by the age of the account.
   * Accounts older than one month but less than one year receive a **5% reduction** in rewards.
2. **Discord Badges**&#x20;
   * Users holding specific badges can receive unique rewards, such as:
     * **Early Supporter**: A badge for supporting the project early.
     * **Bug Hunter**: A badge for reporting bugs and improving the system.
3. **Profile Completeness**
   * Players with a complete profile, including an avatar or a banner, receive **bonus rewards**.
