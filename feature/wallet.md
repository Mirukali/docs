# Wallet

### Overview

The **Wallet** in Miruka is designed to be a seamless gateway between your in-game assets and the blockchain, allowing for easy management of both in-game and external assets right from Discord. With this integration, you can view and manage your assets, track external NFTs, and engage in partnerships, all while keeping your assets secure.

#### Key Features of the Wallet:

* **In-Game Asset Management**: Instantly view your balance of in-game currency, tokens, and other blockchain-based assets.
* **External Wallet Link**: Connect an external wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to your Miruka account, allowing the bot to verify NFTs, tokens, and other assets without needing to transfer them into Discord. This ensures that your valuable assets remain safe in your personal wallet.
* **Guild.xyz Integration**: Collaborate with platforms like Guild.xyz to complete tasks and track assets, enabling task completion rewards based on the items in your external wallet.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Receive live updates on transactions, asset changes, and wallet activity.
* **Secure Transactions**: Transfer tokens, redeem rewards, or purchase items within a secure, blockchain-integrated environment.
* **Flexible Conversion and Exchange**: Convert between in-game currencies (e.g., Gold and MP) directly in the wallet for streamlined gameplay.

With Miruka's wallet feature, you can securely manage both in-game and blockchain assets, allowing for dynamic, verifiable rewards through partnerships, all without risking the loss of your NFTs or tokens. Just type `/wallet` in Discord to access your wallet, link external assets, and start exploring!
