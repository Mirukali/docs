Our bot is primarily built on the **Polygon** network, which provides a fast and cost-effective platform for blockchain-based interactions. However, we also support a variety of other tokens for tipping purposes, giving users the flexibility to send and receive tips in different cryptocurrencies.

**Supported Chains:**

* **Polygon Network**: The main blockchain where the bot operates, offering low transaction fees and quick confirmations.

**Supported Tokens:**

* **Various Tokens**: In addition to the native token of the Polygon network, the bot supports multiple tokens for tipping. These tokens can be sent and received through the bot to facilitate transactions between users.

**How It Works:**

1. **Tipping**: You can send tips to other users using the supported tokens. Simply use the designated tipping command to transfer tokens.
2. **Wallet Integration**: Make sure your wallet is connected to the supported networks and tokens to easily send or receive tips within the bot.

**Notes:**

* Tokens supported for tipping are not used for in-game purchases or exchanges. They are strictly for sending tips to enhance interactions.
* If you'd like to know more about how to use specific tokens, please refer to our detailed guides on wallet setup and supported token usage.

By supporting a variety of tokens, we aim to offer a seamless and flexible experience for all users on our platform, no matter their preferred cryptocurrency.
