## <mark style="color:orange;">**Restricted NFTs**</mark>

Restricted NFTs are digital assets from specific organizations or projects that do not align with the community’s values or goals. While holders of these NFTs are welcome to participate in events, their rewards will be reduced to reflect our commitment to maintaining the integrity of the community.

* **Why are certain NFTs restricted?**\
  The restriction ensures rewards go to participants who align with the community's vision.
* **Can restricted NFT holders still participate?**\
  Yes, but they will not receive exclusive rewards like NFTs or Limited Roles, and their Miru Points will be reduced.

## <mark style="color:orange;">**Transparency and FAQ**</mark>

**1. Why are rewards reduced for certain participants?**\

**2. What qualifies as a restricted NFT?**\
Restricted NFTs are associated with organizations that do not share or support the project’s goals. A list of restricted NFTs may be shared internally but not made public.

**3. Can restricted NFT holders join events?**\
Yes, they can participate but will receive reduced rewards to align with the community’s values.

**4. Is this policy permanent?**\
This policy is subject to review based on community feedback and project development.
